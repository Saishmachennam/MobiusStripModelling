# Möbius Strip Modeling

A Python project that models and visualizes a **Möbius strip** — a one-sided surface — using parametric equations, numerical geometry, and 3D visualization.

## Features

* **3D Parametric Modeling:** Generates a detailed mesh of the Möbius strip with customizable radius, width, and resolution.
* **Numerical Geometry:**

  * Approximates surface area using the cross product of partial derivatives and numerical integration.
  * Computes the edge length along the strip’s boundary.
* **Visualization:** Beautiful, smooth 3D rendering with gradient coloring using Matplotlib.
* **User-friendly:** Comes with sensible default parameters and optional input prompts (commented for flexibility).
* **Clean & Modular:** Well-structured, documented, and easy to extend or modify.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mobius-strip.git
   cd mobius-strip
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

---

## Usage

Run the script directly with Python:

```bash
python mobius_strip.py
```

The script will:

* Calculate and print the Möbius strip’s surface area and edge length.
* Display a 3D plot of the Möbius strip with an attractive color gradient.

### Optional Inputs

To customize radius, width, and resolution, uncomment the input section in the main block of the script and enter your values at runtime.

## Code Structure

* **`MobiusStrip` class:** Encapsulates all modeling, computation, and visualization logic.
* **Parametric equations:** Defines the strip surface in terms of `(u, v)`.
* **Numerical methods:** Compute surface area and edge length via integration and distance sums.
* **Plotting:** Uses Matplotlib’s 3D plotting with color mapping for enhanced visuals.

## Challenges & Notes

* Achieving an accurate and visually appealing Möbius strip required balancing resolution and strip width.
* Surface area calculation uses partial derivatives and numerical integration for precision.
* Visualization was enhanced with smooth color gradients to better illustrate the shape.
